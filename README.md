# JadeRadke_MiniDataAnalysis

## This repository contains milestones 1 and 2 of my Mini Data Analysis for my STAT545A class at UBC. 

*Milestone 1* involved exploring data sets and becoming familiar with one that we choose. I chose the steam_games data set from datateachr. It also involved developing research questions and manipulating and summarizing data using dplyr with these research questions in mind.

*Milestone 2* involved creating tidy data, manipulating special data types in R, fitting a model object to our data, and reading and writing data as separate files. 

If you would like to explore the  project, start with opening Milestone 1 in R, followed by Milestone 2. If you would like to see the separate files that were made during Milestone 2, you can look in the output folder. Make sure you run all of the codes from the beginning, or else some later codes may not work (due to the fact that I created new tibbles and data subsets throughout this project). 

Thanks for looking!
